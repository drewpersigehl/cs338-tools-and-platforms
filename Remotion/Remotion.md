# Remotion

## Start a project
We will start by creating a project.

In your terminal enter:
```
npm init video
```
You may be asked to install some packages. Say yes.

Name your video whatever you like. Choose the "Blank" template.

A Node.js project will be built for you. Most of your work will be done within the /src directory.

## Using the example code

We've provided an example project called 'practice-video' that creates a Ken Burns style video from a set of images.

To use the example code:

1. Clone the repository to your machine
2. Navigate to the remotion-example directory
3. Run 'npm install' in your terminal
4. Run 'npm start' to open the in-browser interface 

Some things to know:

- The image files are located in the /public directory which is on the same level as /src
-
